
Policy as Code
---
Use JSON/YAML files to create resources on the panos panorama.

1) The JSON files must be able to validate two different github actions (one checking for duplicate object names and one making sure it validates against the provided schemas).
2) There are two modules : policy and security profiles which can create different resources on the panos panorama depending on what file you put into the module.

Usage
---
```
module "policy" {
  source = "./modules/policy"

  #for yaml files "./files/yaml/..."
  tags_file       = "./files/json/tags.json"
  services_file   = "./files/json/services.json"
  addr_group_file = "./files/json/addr_group.json"
  addr_obj_file   = "./files/json/addr_obj.json"
  sec_file        = "./files/json/sec_policy.json"
  nat_file        = "./files/json/nat.json"
}

module "sec_prof" {
  source = "./modules/sec_profiles"

  #for yaml file "./files/yaml/..."
  antivirus_file     = "./files/json/antivirus.json"
  file_blocking_file = "./files/json/file_blocking.json"
  wildfire_file      = "./files/json/wildfire.json"
  vulnerability_file = "./files/json/vulnerability.json"
  spyware_file       = "./files/json/spyware.json"
}
```
